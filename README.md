# Build a REST API in Spring

This code is generated in the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) course [Build a REST API in Spring](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-rest-api-in-spring).

In this workshop we will build a secured, HATEOAS compliant RESTful API using the Spring Data umbrella project [Spring Data REST](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/).

There are `git tags` that coincide with videos in the workshop.  You can use this to make sure that your code is at the same point I am at in the video.  

For instance, if you want to have your code exactly like Stage 1 Video 3, perform the git command:

`git checkout s1v3`

Happy coding!
